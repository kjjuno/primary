> We hear the words our prophet declares:  
> "Let each who's worthy go forth and share."
> 
> **Verse 3**  
> We know his plan, and we will prepare,  
> Increase our knowledge through study and prayer.  
> Daily we'll learn until we are called  
> To take the gospel to all the world.  
>
> **Chorus**  
> We are as the army of Helaman.

Singing Time Plan
-----------------

In general I will be following [this blog post](http://www.camillesprimaryideas.com/2013/05/well-bring-world-his-truth.html)

Tell the story of the 2000 stripling warriors

I'll hang the picture on the center of the chalkboard and underneath it write with chalk,
"we are as the army of Helaman."

I'll have the pianist play that line and we'll then sing it.
Then around the picture I'll gradually add the rest of the lines

"we have been taught in our youth,"  
"we will be the Lord's Missionaries"  
"to bring the world His truth."

We'll go over the learned chorus a few times, having the children stand up pretending to be like warriors - singing with courage, being bold and brave, etc.

I'll bear testimony at the end that if we can be like these 2000 Stripling Warriors, we will always have the strength of the Lord with us.

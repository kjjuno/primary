Away in a Manger
----------------

> *Verse 1*
> Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
> The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head;
> The stars in theheavens looked down where he lay,
> The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.

> *Chrous*
> Asleep, (asleep), asleep, (asleep)
> Asleep, the Savior in a stall!
> Asleep, (asleep), asleep, (asleep)
> Asleep, the lord of all.

> *Verse 2*
> The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes;
> But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.
> I love thee, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky
> And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.

> *Verse 3*
> Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
> Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
> Bless all the dear children in they tender care,
> And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.

Picture a Christmas
-------------------

> *Verse 1*  
> Picture a stable in Judea.  
> Picture a sacred, silent night.  
> And can you hear  
> The angels near  
> And see the star so bright?  
> 
> *Chorus*  
> Picture the little baby Jesus.  
> Think of his life and words so dear.  
> Sing praise to him;  
> Remember him,  
> As you picture Christmas this year.  
> 
> *Verse 2*  
> Picture the kind and gentle Joseph.  
> Picture the mother, Mary, fair.  
> And can you see  
> So rev'rently  
> The shepherds kneeling there?  

We will go through each line of the song. We will either draw, or use a prop to represent the lines of the song.

When approprite invite children to come place a piece of the nativity.

Singing Time game
-----------------

I will divide the room into two sides. I will call on children from each
side of the room. We will announce which song, and which verse we are singing.
The list will be below. Bro Armstrong will play the song, and will choose when
to stop playing. All the primary children will sing along. As soon as the
music stops the two kids in the front will race to grab the ____. The first
child to grab it will have the chance to say what the next words to the
song are. If they answer correctly their team will get a point. If they
answer incorrectly the other child will have a chance to answer. If nobody
gets it right I will choose a child using the sticks and they will have a
chance to score a point for their team.

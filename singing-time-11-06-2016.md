Away in a Manger
----------------

> *Verse 1*  
> Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,  
> The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head;  
> The stars in theheavens looked down where he lay,  
> The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.
>
> *Chrous*  
> Asleep, (asleep), asleep, (asleep)  
> Asleep, the Savior in a stall!  
> Asleep, (asleep), asleep, (asleep)  
> Asleep, the lord of all.
>
> *Verse 2*  
> The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes;  
> But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.  
> I love thee, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky  
> And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.
>
> *Verse 3*  
> Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay  
> Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.  
> Bless all the dear children in they tender care,  
> And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.

A Song of Thanks
----------------

> Thank thee for the world so sweet;  
> Thank thee for the food we eat;  
> Thank thee for the birds that sing;  
> Thank the, God, for everything!

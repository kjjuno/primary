## Singing Time - Super Bowl
A volunteer will be chosen from the team that "has the ball"

Bro Armstrong will choose a song.
For Jr. Primary play the first two lines.
for Sr. Primary play the first two measures of the intro.

The volunteer will be asked to guess the song. If they can't do it alone
they can ask their team. They are then given the choice to sing the first verse
as a solo, with a couple of friends, or as a team.

If the volunteer cannot identify the song by themselves we will roll a die.
If we roll a 5 or a 6 the other team has a chance to "intercept" the ball.
A volunteer on the opposing team will be selected to identify the song by themselves.
If they can they have "intercepted" the ball. If the intercepting player can
sing the first verse as a solo they will advance the ball 20 yards.

Once a team gets the ball they will have 4 downs to score a touchdown. There are
no fieldgoals, safety's, or extra points. A touchdown is worth 7 points.

I will ask a few teachers to help me be "refirees". If a team is being irreverent
the refiree can throw a yellow flag and call a 10 yard penalty.

There will only be one period. We will play for the full 15 min. Whichever team is
ahead at the end of the time will be the winners.

For Jr Primary make everything worth 10 more yards.

### 50 Yards
The volunteer must guess what the song is by themselves. And sing the first verse as a solo.

### 40 Yards
The volunteer must guess the song by themselves. They can invite up to two friends on their team to sing the first verse with them.

### 40 Yards
The volunteer must guess the song with the help of their team. They must
sing the first verse as a solo.

### 30 Yards
The volunteer must guess the song by themselves. The whole team must sing
the first verse together.

### 20 Yards
The volunteer must guess the song with the help of their team. They can invite
up to two friends on their team to sing the first verse with them.

### 10 Yards
The team must guess the song together. The whole team must sing the first verse
together.

We'll Bring the World His Truth (172)
-------------------------------------

> **Verse 1**  
> We have been born, as Nephi of old,  
> To goodly parents who love the Lord.  
> We have been taught, and we understand,  
> That we must do as the Lord commands.
>
> **Verse 2**  
> We have been saved for these latter days  
> To build the kingdom in righteous ways.  
> We hear the words our prophet declares:  
> "Let each who's worthy go forth and share."
> 
> **Verse 3**  
> We know his plan, and we will prepare,  
> Increase our knowledge through study and prayer.  
> Daily we'll learn until we are called  
> To take the gospel to all the world.  
>
> **Chorus**  
> We are as the army of Helaman.  
> We have been taught in our youth.  
> And we will be the Lord's missionaries  
> To bring the world his truth.

Singing Time Plan
-----------------

In general I will be following [this blog post](http://www.camillesprimaryideas.com/2013/05/well-bring-world-his-truth.html)

I will invite 8 kids to come up and hold pictures. Each picture is a clue to the words in the song.
We will sing through the words that the pictures represent. 

Once we have gone through the entire verse I will ask 3 children to sit down, and we will sing it again.
Again, I will ask 3 children to sit down, and we will sing the 1st verse. Then the remaining 2 will sit down.

I will repeat this pattern for all of the verses. There will probably only be time for 1 or 2 verses, but we will
get through as much as possible.

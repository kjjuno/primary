I will start by talking about the words Thanks and Giving.

Then, I will have all the letters for THANSGIVING in a bowl. Children will
come up and draw a letter out of the bowl. They will share one thing
they are grateful for that starts with that letter, and they will
also choose a song that starts with that letter. We will then sing
the song they chose.

For Junior Primary I will help them select a song if they can't think of one quickly.
